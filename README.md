# Web Calendar Application - JavaScript, HTML & CSS 📅✨

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains the source code for my **Web Calendar Application**. The app allows users to interact with a fully functional calendar built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

The project is designed to help users view dates, navigate between months, and display events for any given day. It was created as part of my **Frontend Development practice** during my studies in **Advanced Vocational Training in Web Application Development** (*Grado Superior de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web*).

## About Me 💻

I'm a **Junior Backend Developer** with a growing passion for frontend development. While I primarily focus on the backend, I enjoy tackling challenges that involve **UI/UX design** and creating interactive web applications. This project allowed me to sharpen my skills in **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML** while creating a practical, user-friendly tool.

I first discovered my love for programming during my **Higher Vocational Training in Web Application Development** (*Grado Superior de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web*), and I continue to expand my knowledge in both backend and frontend technologies. This project is an excellent example of my ability to build complete, interactive web applications from scratch! ✨

## Why I Love Frontend Development ❤️

Frontend development is about building interactive and visually appealing experiences. With each project, I enjoy the challenge of combining **logic** and **design**. Here's a small JavaScript snippet that celebrates my love for creating functional and engaging web applications:
